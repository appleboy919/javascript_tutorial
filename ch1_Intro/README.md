# Ch1. Introduction to JavaScript

- Javascript is used in everywhere, browser, server, computer, etc
- JSX: syntax extension of JavaScript created for React JavaScript framework --> Therefore, need to learn JavaScript FIRST!!

## JavaScript Landscape

1. JavaScript(Vanilla JavaScript): core language
2. ECMAScript: browser implementation specification for JavaScript
   - Not language itself, official description of how language should be interpreted by browsers
   - Use Babel.js to make it work in current browser implementations
3. TypeScript: abstracted version of JS with additional features added (.ts)
4. Frameworks: allow to write JS-based fron-end applications
   - React, Vue, Angular
   - add an abstraction layer on top of JS --> more streamlined and efficient
5. Babel, npm, WebPack, Gulp: build tools and infrastructure to automate the process of optimizing human-readable JS for the best browser performance
6. Node.js: JS server runtime used to run JS everywhere; used to run npm, WebPack, Babel, and more on computers
   - JS migrated from browser to server
